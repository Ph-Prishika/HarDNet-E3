# HarDNet-E2
### Enhanced Harmonic Dense Connectivity for Pediatric Renal Ultrasound Classification

HarDNet-E2 is a structured reformulation of HarDNet85 designed for speckle-dominated pediatric renal ultrasound imaging.  
The model introduces shallow-to-deep semantic reinforcement and structured even-layer aggregation with optional squeeze-and-excitation (SE) recalibration and residual fusion.

This repository provides training, evaluation, calibration, and visualization utilities for reproducible medical image classification experiments.
